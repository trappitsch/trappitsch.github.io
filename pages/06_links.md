This is a collection of links that I regularly use or want to keep in mind. I post it here publicly in case somebody else is interested in it and it might be of help. It is a quite random assortment of links that could be useful to other people as well. Also: I will constantly update this page whenever I come across something new, so keep that in mind.

<h3>Cosmochemistry News</h3>

 - [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html){:target="_blank"}: Classics are always in style!
 - [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/){:target="_blank"}: Physics / Astrophysics preprint server.
 - [Cosmochemistry Papers](https://cosmochemistry-papers.com/){:target="_blank"}: Great resource that publishes the lates publications related to cosmochemistry

<h3>Databases</h3>
 - [Actinide atomic spectra](http://web2.lac.u-psud.fr/lac/Database/Contents.html){:target="_blank"}: Special atomic energy and spectra database for actinides. Has much more information than NIST database for these elements.
 - [JANIS 4.0](https://www.oecd-nea.org/janis/){:target="_blank"}: OECD-NEA nuclear data information system. Online tool and java based software available.
 - [NIST atomic spectra database](https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-spectra-database){:target="_blank"}: Database for looking up atomic energies and spectra.
 - [RILIS](http://riliselements.web.cern.ch/riliselements/index.php?location=all&lasuse=all&special=none){:target="_blank"}: Database with RIMS spectra, maintained by CERN.

 
<h3>Instrumentation / Hardware</h3>
 - [Galvant Instrument Kit](https://github.com/Galvant/InstrumentKit){:target="_blank"}: Driver / communication package for communication between Python and Hardware.

<h3>Software</h3>
 - [Chart of the nuclides drawer](https://github.com/kmiernik/Chart-of-nuclides-drawer){:target="_blank"}: Python script to plot the whole chart of the nuclides using the nuclear data wallet numbers and prints it as an svg. Color scheme based on Karlsruher Nuklidkart but can be customized. 
 - [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/){:target="_blank"}: A classic at this point I assume, Inkscape is amazing when handling vector graphics and importing / exporting for proper figure handling. And best of all, fully open source.
 - [Veusz](https://veusz.github.io/){:target="_blank"}: I was long looking for an open source tool to replace the final software need I had - a plotting program. I found it in Veusz. Absolutely fantastic program!
 - [yt-project](http://yt-project.org/){:target="_blank"}: If you need python and don't want to install from scratch, look no further. YT is the solution to any of your problems.
