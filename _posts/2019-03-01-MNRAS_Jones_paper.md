Our recent work on new core-collapse supernova nucleosynthesis further solidify that Solar System formation was not triggered by such an event.

In a recent paper by [Jones et al. (2019)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stz536/5362650) we determined supernova nucleosynthesis yields depending on the <sup>59</sup>Fe(n, Î³) reaction rate. These new models show that even if this cross section is varyied within its theoretical uncertainties, the low <sup>60</sup>Fe/<sup>56</sup>Fe ratio found in the early Solar System material cannot be explained by a supernova injection, since such an injection. If a supernova contributed the <sup>26</sup>Al to the early Solar System it would simultaneously contribute too much <sup>60</sup>Fe to agree with [recent measurements](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aabba9/meta).
