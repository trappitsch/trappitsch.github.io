title: Resonance Ionization of Titanium &mdash; A new scheme
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

We recently developed a new resonance ionization scheme to ionize titanium using three tunable Ti:Sapphire lasers. All transitions can be easily saturated and our new scheme is suitable for trace-element isotopic measurements due to it's high useful yield.

Using three Ti:Sapphire lasers we resonantly ionize titanium as shown in the Figure on the right. The developed scheme also allowed us to access all low-lying state in the <sup>3</sup>F ground-state manifold. While the transition originating on the <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub> state could not be fully saturated, all other transitions are easily saturatable. 

We find that more than half of the sputtered neutral titanium atoms are in the <sup>3</sup>F<sub>2</sub> and show a useful yield of 10.1% for that specific state. Overall, we predict a useful yield of ~18%, assuming that all transitions can be saturated.
