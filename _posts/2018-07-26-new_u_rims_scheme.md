title: New, improved uranium RIMS scheme
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

Our new and improved uranium resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) scheme, just accepted a couple of days ago for publication in Analytical Chemistry, shows that we can achieve useful yields of up to 38% for the analysis of uranium.

This means that around 4 out of every 10 atoms removed from the sample are actually counted in our detector. 

Such a high useful yield was possible thanks to a newly developed uranium ionization scheme that can access the ground state as well as a low lying excited state simultaneously.
