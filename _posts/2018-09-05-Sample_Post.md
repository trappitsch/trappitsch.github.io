title: Study of the Uranium low-lying excited state occupancies

Using the Livermore Laser Ionization of Neutrals (LION) instrument we determined the occupancy of ground vs excited state uranium after sputtering and witih respect to the oxidization state. This work was recently published in Spetrochimica Acta Part B.

To achieve these measurements we used our recently developed U ionization scheme, which allows us to access the ground state as well as the low-lying excited state simultneously. In order to measure the two states quasi-simultaneously, we interleaved the individual measurements. The time-of-flight mass spectrometer on LION runs with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. By interleaving the measurement, i.e., measuring the ground state at 1 kHz and the excited state only at 500 Hz (every other time) we could determine the exact occupancies while the sample itself was reoxidizing. 

These measurements were mainly made possible due to our in-house developed data reduction technique that allows us to analyze every individual ion that arrives on the detector.
