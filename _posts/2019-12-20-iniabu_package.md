A new python package to automatically read in and calculate intial abundnaces for solar system values according and delta values using literature data is now online. 
<!--more-->

In a recent effort, we published a python package that can be installed via pip (or directly if you so wish). This package can be used easily access literature values for initial solar system abundances of elements and isotopes, but can also calculate delta-values for cosmochemists and bracket notation for astrophysicists. Hopefully, this is also useful for other people. Currently the database of [Lodders (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88055-4_34) is included, but further databases can easily be added upon request. Please send me an e-mail if you would like other databases to be added (and ideally provide me with a machine readable file that contains the isotopic abundnaces. 

Please also let me know if you find bugs in the software, and I'm always happy to hear from you as well if you like it and it's useful. Have fun and happy holidays!

Here is the link to the package and a tutorial on how to set it up and use it:
